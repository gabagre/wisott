# wisott

What It Says On The Tin

---

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.6.

## BLUF

Wisott is a work in progress. It aims to be a one-stop-shop way of setting up a baseline Angular-based website. Wisott uses Node for the server side software. [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/) is included for creating a consistent look and feel for the website.

## Use cases

None. For now. Just use the Angular CLI.

## Purpose

Wisott is meant to be an Angular environment-in-a-tin. Git clone, change into the directory, and run `yarn run start` to build the Angular app and start Node in the background. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to see the app running. Ctrl-c to kill the server process.

## Development server

Run `yarn run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. The dev server behaviour currently comes from the Angular CLI tooling.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `yarn run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. For a production build, use `yarn run build:prod`. For both commands, both Angular and the Node server software will be built.

## Running unit tests

Run `yarn run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). Run `yarn run test:www` to run server tests using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `yarn run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
